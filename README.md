# Booking Hackathon Project

This repository is where the functions hosted in IBM cloud functions were implemented in Ruby and shared through the group members.

The functions make specific requests to be called inside the chatbot. The requests use the Booking API and additional data, originally hosted in AWS S3.

## Usage

To use the functions you must run 'bundle install' to install all ruby gems used in the requests. The parameters and return are all explained in commentaries in each function.
